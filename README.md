## Project
This is the product of a practical project of some students of the FHNW School of Business. The prototype is able to find websites with information about different software products and evaluate the quality of those products with natural language processing.

For the implementation we use following tools:
- Laravel: PHP Web-Application framework
- Google Programmable Search Engine
- MeaningCloud
- RapidMiner: Natural Language Processing

## Usage
To use scouti there are several systems involved. For a full instruction, visit the [guide](https://github.com/MathisHermann/scouti/tree/master/Project/Documentation).
